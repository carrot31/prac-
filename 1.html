    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>This page gives some rough guidelines which most Wikipedia editors use to decide if a form of web-specific
        content, being either the content of a website or the specific website itself, should have an article on
        Wikipedia. Web content includes, but is not limited to, blogs, Internet forums, newsgroups, online magazines,
        other media, podcasts, webcomics, and web portals. Any content accessed via the internet and engaged with
        primarily through a web browser is considered web content for the purposes of this guideline.[1]

        Wikipedians are averse to the use of Wikipedia for advertising, and the idea that Wikipedia articles are not
        advertisements is an official policy of long standing. Advertising is either cleaned up to adhere to the neutral
        point of view or deleted.[2]

        Wikipedia is not a web directory, in that it is not a site that specializes in linking to other web sites and
        categorizing those links. Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files. Articles
        which merely include an external link and a brief description of its contents may be deleted.</p>
